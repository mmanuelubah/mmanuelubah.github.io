excerpt: Even in uncertainty and feeling left behind, I trust that I am in good hands — in God's hands.
---
There are seasons when I feel lost — unsure of my next step, uncertain about where my life is heading.  
Some days the weight feels heavier, especially when it seems like everyone else is moving ahead while I am still waiting.  

But deep inside, I believe I am in **good hands** — not just any hands, but God’s hands.  
The same hands that guided the people in the Bible through deserts, storms, and prisons.  
The same hands that turned impossibilities into testimonies.  

I think about David hiding in caves, Elijah feeling alone under the broom tree, and even Paul writing letters from prison.  
They all knew moments of weariness and doubt. Yet, they also knew the unshakable truth: *God will make a way, even in the wilderness.*  

When I remind myself of this, I begin to loosen my grip on fear.  
I open myself to the possibility that this season has purpose, even if I can’t yet see it.  
I can trust Him to lead me where I need to go, in His time, not mine.  

So while I may not have all the answers, I hold onto the one thing I know for sure:  
I have something worth fighting for, and I am not walking this path alone.  

> “See, I am doing a new thing! Now it springs up; do you not perceive it?  
> I am making a way in the wilderness and streams in the wasteland.”  
> *— Isaiah 43:19*
